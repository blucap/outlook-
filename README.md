# This VBA (for Outlook) script shows how you can use Outlook to manage outgoing emails

- It challenges the sender when sending to multiple receipients and lists
- It allows a sender to categorise an email as delayed, which then will send the email the next working day
- Emails composed outse working hours be categorised as delayed, unless sender chosses otherwide.

To enable easy categorising emails, customise the ribbon of a new email, and add "Message options"to the ribbon.
